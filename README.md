# Interactive DVD Logo

```
Our concept idea is to create an interactive bouncing DVD Logo Screensaver. The user can
interact with the bouncing logo by using motion capture on processing. The software detects
user motion by webcam to interact with the particle on the screen. The particles bounce
around the screen fast or slow depending on the size of the particle and userâ€™s motion when
interacting with it. Sound will be generated every time the user interacts with the particles or
when the particles hit the screen frame.
